    <h2><a href="index.html" id="main-link">LDPL</a> Libraries</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>As most programming languages, LDPL leverages a number of first and third-party libraries. Nearly all of these libraries are released in the form of a <i>.ldpl</i> file, a group of <i>.ldpl</i> files or a group of <i>.ldpl</i> and C++ files. </p>
        
    <p>The process of installing an LDPL library is fairly straightforward: locate the library file (or the main library file, in case the library you want to import has multiple files) and import it to your LDPL source file by using the <i>include</i> keyword. For example, if you have two files <i>source.ldpl</i> and <i>lib.ldpl</i> in a folder and you want to import <i>lib.ldpl</i> into <i>source.ldpl</i>, you should add the line <code>include "lib.ldpl"</code> into <i>source.ldpl</i> before the <i>data</i> and <i>procedure</i> sections. </p>
    
    <p>This is explained in greater detail in the <a href="https://docs.ldpl-lang.org/structure/#including-more-source-files" target=_blank>LDPL Documentation</a>.
    
    <p>First-party LDPL libraries are listed on this page. You may also find libraries on <a href="https://github.com/search?q=ldpl" target=_blank>GitHub by searching "LDPL"</a> in the search box. If you have written an LDPL library and you'd like to have it listed here, please contact us. 
    
    <h2>LDPL Package Manager (LPM)</h2>
    
    <p>Starting from version 4.3, LDPL includes the LDPL Package Manager (LPM). When you install LDPL from source you also install LPM. If you download a pre-compiled binary, LPM is included in the same package. With LPM, downloading and using libraries (we also call them packages) is now easier than ever:</p>
    
    <p>
        <ul>
        <li>Run <code>lpm info &lt;library_name&gt;</code> to find information about a particular library.
        <ul>
        <li>Try, for example, <code>lpm info std-math</code> and <code>lpm info ltb</code>!</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Run <code>lpm install &lt;library_name&gt;</code> to install a particular library.</li>
        <li>Run <code>lpm uninstall &lt;library_name&gt;</code> to uninstall a particular library.</li>
        <li>Run <code>lpm count</code> to display the number of installed packages.</li>
        <li>Run <code>lpm list</code> to list all installed packages.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>Once you've installed a library, you can include it to your project by just adding the line</p>
    
    <p><code>using package &lt;library_name&gt;<br># for example: using package std-math</code></p>
    
    <p>before the <code>DATA</code> and <code>PROCEDURE</code> sections of your source file.</p>
    
    <h2>Official LDPL Libraries</h2>
    
    <h3>The LDPL Standard Library</h3>
    
    
    <p><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/ldpl-std" target=_blank>The LDPL Standard Library (STD)</a> a collection of LDPL libraries that contain many useful pre-written statements for the LDPL Programming Language that are not included in the base language. he library is organized in a series of <i>.ldpl</i> files lovingly called <i>briefcases</i> (this is a very serious language, you know, we have ties) each containing new statements designed to extend the functionality of LDPL in many areas, for example list handling or random number generation.
