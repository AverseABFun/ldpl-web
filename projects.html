    <p>
    This page is a collection of all the LDPL projects we could find.
    We would love to add more! If you have written a project in LDPL
    and would like us to add it to this list, please contact us.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><b>led (by Lartu)</b> (<a href="https://github.com/lartu/led">link</a>)
        <p>led, the LDPL Text Editor, is a line text editor written in LDPL, inspired by the ed and sed text editors, but friendlier!
        
        <li><b>ldpl todo (by dvkt)</b> (<a href="https://github.com/dvkt/ldpl-todo">link</a>)
        <p>Dirt simple todos cli.
        
        <li><b>Lute (by Lartu)</b> (<a href="https://github.com/Lartu/lute" >link</a>)
        <p>Lute, Lartu's Utility for Text Editing, is a simple, no-nonsense text editor for Unix and general *nix systems written in LDPL. While written as a proof of concept for the LDPL Programming Language, Lute is completely functional and has been written using mostly itself as the text editor for its code.
        
        <li><b>Dino (by dvkt)</b> (<a href="https://github.com/dvkt/dino" >link</a>)
        <p>Dino is an interpreter for the LDPL programming language, written in
        LDPL. Because LDPL is a compiled language, Dino's goal is to provide a
        lightweight, scriptable version of the language that can be used to
        quickly prototype ideas or perform system tasks. Dino can also be used
        to run basic LDPL programs on systems which lack a C++ compiler, or to
        experiment with new LDPL language features and syntax. Mostly, though,
        it's a prehistoric toy.
       
        <li><b>Gild (by dvkt)</b> (<a href="https://github.com/dvkt/gild" >link</a>)
        <p>GILD is a gopher client for the terminal written in LDPL, a language for programmers. Features:</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
        <li>Surf your favorite Gopherholes in glorious technicolor!</li>
        <li>Quick, no-nonsense prompt-based navigation.</li>
        <li>Supports menus, files, and searches.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <li><b>LDPL Space Mines (by carbontwelve)</b> (<a href="https://github.com/photogabble/ldpl-space-mines" >link</a>)
        <p>This is a port to LDPL of a BASIC strategy/management game called Space Mines. The BASIC code was originally published in 1982 in an Usborne book titled Computer Space-games. In the same year the game was released on tape for the ZX Spectrum 16K, click here for more information and a download link to the Spectrum tape image.
        
        <li><b>LDPL Spark (by carbontwelve)</b> (<a href="https://github.com/photogabble/ldpl-spark" >link</a>)
        <p>This is a port to LDPL of the BASH Shell script spark. It doesn't 100% duplicate the functionality because you can't pipe values in nor will it accept comma delimited input (yet?)
        
        <li><b>Ambulisp (by ambulancja)</b> (<a href="https://github.com/ambulancja/ambulisp" >link</a>)
        <p>LISP Interpreter written in LDPL.
        
        <li><b>LBI (by lartu)</b> (<a href="https://github.com/Lartu/LBI" >link</a>)
        <p>Lartu's Brainfuck Interpreter - A Brainfuck Interpreter written in LDPL
        
        <li><b>beKnowledge (by lartu)</b> (<a href="https://github.com/Lartu/beKnowledge" >link</a>)
        <p>beKnowledge is a tool designed to help you read faster by letting you read without moving your eyes. beKnowledge shows you words one after another in the same place at your choosen pace. It also gives you pauses to blink and a pause every 1000 words so you can rest your eyes and drink a sip of your coffee.
