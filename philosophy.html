    <h2><a href="index.html" id="main-link">LDPL</a> Philosophy and Goals</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
    LDPL (<i>LDPL, the Dinosaur Programming Language</i>)
    is a language designed to be easy to understand and simple to write.
    Designed to be easy to learn and simple to use. We believe that coding
    should be easy and simple. Nothing should become a frustrating chore.
    Compiling source code should be easy and simple: a single, flagless command
    should be enough to compile any source code. Every statement in the language
    should do one and one thing only, not multiple things depending on the
    context. Complex, low level stuff like encoding, sockets, floating point
    number comparison, etc., should be dealt by the compiler, transparently to
    the user. Hard stuff should be made easier.
    </p>
        
    <p>
    We understand that this philosophy may lead to longer source code, more
    verbose statements and extra steps to reach an end, but we also believe
    that it should make coding in LDPL easier and more enjoyable than in other
    languages.
    </p>
        
    <p>
    As one user once put it, <em>"Usually when I'm programming, I feel like I'm
    in a big fancy jet and there's a lot of turbulence and it's not going well
    but then all of a sudden it's smooth air again and the drink cart comes
    along and I get a ginger ale and it's great. But with LDPL, I feel like I'm
    a cub scout out in the woods with a box of matches and a hatchet and my
    Scout's Handbook (the LDPL Docs) just exploring and figuring it out as I
    go. Whenever I run into a problem I just check my handbook and, sure
    enough, there's a solution right there waiting for me!"</em>.
    </p>
        
    <p>
    We want to make LDPL a language you'll love not because it lets you do
    many things in one line, nor because of the way it runs, nor because of how
    modern it is: but because it's designed to stay by your side and tell you
    everything's gonna be okay even when times get dark.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    
    <p>
    Obviously, each developer working on the LDPL project has their own aims
    and priorities, but it is possible to classify the goals we all share: 
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><p>Create a complete, turing-complete programming language that is easy to use and understand, that is clean and minimal.</p></li>
        <li><p>Design the language and its <a href="libraries.html">libraries</a> in such a way that hard to
        do things become easier.</p></li>
        <li><p>Develop a compiler that doesn't expect endless flags in order to build
        a source, that is fast and simple. <a href="https://github.com/lartu/ldpl">Provide full source code access to developers
        and users</a>, and integrate into it valuable contributions from anyone willing to
        <a href="contribute.html">contribute.</a></p></li>
        <li><p><b>Mantain good relationship with all members of the LDPL community
        (users, developers, collaborators, etc.) and make everyone feel welcome.</b>
        Everyone must be respected and their ideas taken into consideration.</p></li>
        <li><p>Make the LDPL language, its compiler and its source code available
        for everyone for any purpose, with no restrictions. <b>We strive to make
        our language robust and stable</b>, and encourage users and companies alike
        to use whichever pieces they want to.</p></li>
        <li><p>Do not let serious problems sit unsolved.</p></li>
        <li><p>Mantain retrocompatiblity between releases.</p></li>
        <li><p>Make a release approximately every three months.</p></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Release Schedule, Versioning and Support</h2>
    
    <p>
    LDPL started as an indie project and, as such, we did commit some mistakes
    when releasing and versioning our releases. As you may see in the
    <a href="news.html">news</a> page, we jumped from LDPL 1.1.0 to 1.1.2 to
    2.0.4, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.3, etc. We also did not have a proper release
    schedule, so releases were released as soon as they came out of the oven,
    leaving our users with no time to prepare for the next update.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    While we consider this may have been a necessary bad when the project was
    at its very early stages, now that it is mature and stable we have
    aknowledged these are <b>not</b> good practices, as the growth of the
    project it is not consistent, predictable nor transparent to our users.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    From <b>LDPL 4.4</b> onwards this has changed. LDPL releases are issued
    once every approximately <b>three months</b>, only if enough new features were
    added to the language since the last stable release.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    LDPL releases from <b>LDPL 4.3</b> onwards implement <b>semantic
    versioning</b>: <i>major.minor.patch</i>. Major versions modify the language
    in a non-retrocompatible manner. Minor versions add features to the language
    in a retrocompatible way. Patch releases fix bugs found in already released
    versions. The initial release of a new LDPL version will be <i>X.Y.0</i>.
    In these cases, the patch number will be omitted (4.3 instead of 4.3.0).
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>Minor</b> LDPL releases will be <b>supported</b> until a new minor
    version is released. Upgrading in this scenario should not be a problem as new
    minor versions are compatible with older minor versions. <b>Major</b> LDPL
    releases will still be supported for <b>at least three months</b> after a
    new major version is released.
