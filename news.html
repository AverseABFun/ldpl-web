        LDPL 4.0 'Diligent Dreadnoughtus' has been released. Rawrrr! This release reworks a great part of the language, fixes all the bugs introduced in LDPL 3.0.5 and marks a new milestone in the history of LDPL! This release is not backwards compatible with 3.0.x LDPL releases, as most of the redundant statements have been moved into the LDPL Standard Library.

    <p>
        LDPL 3.0.3 'Active Argentinosaurus' has been released. Rawrrr! This release mostly addresses bugfixes for bugs found in LDPL 3.0.0. Versions 3.0.1 and 3.0.2 did not receive a formal release, thus the leap to 3.0.3.
    </p>
    <p>As we aren't releasing bugfix versions anymore (just regular language releases with incremental features and bugfixes from the previous version), the version numbering system will now reflect <i>retrocompatibility breaking standard version.major version.minor version</i>. Also, the -ns compiler flag has been partially added (for Linux only, Windows and macOS build non-statically by default). 
    A new statement STORE QUOTE has been added to the language and documented in the reference. This is also the first release to bear a dinosaur code-name.

    <h3>2019-4-13: LDPL 3.0.0 Released</h3>

    <p>
        This is LDPL 3.0.0, expanding the horizons of the language! This new version is the biggest update yet since the release of LDPL, mostly thanks to the tireless work of ʇʞʌp. LDPL now has C++ compatibility, so you can share LDPL variables and functions with C++ (and viceversa) and, among other things, use LDPL to create graphic applications (with SDL) or use any other C++ library you'd like (provided you write an LDPL compatible wrapper for it).

<p>The new extension is documented in the reference. Support for LABEL and GOTO statements has also been added due to popular request, so you can go make Dijkstra turn in his grave (you monsters). There's also a new ELSE IF, with support for all the same statements as the regular IF.

<p>This release has been tested and should work stably, but please report any bugs you find should you come across one.
